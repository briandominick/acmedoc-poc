[TIP]
The above content is drawn from a file generated by LiquiDoc.
It starts as semi-structured data (see `_data/products.yml`).
This AsciiDoc file (`src/portal/product-overview.adoc`) selectively calls sections of that generated file (`build/includes/built/product-info.adoc`), depending on which products the current user role needs to see.
